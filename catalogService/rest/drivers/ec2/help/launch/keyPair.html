<b>Key Pair</b><br/>
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides you with the ability to securely log into your running instance(s).  To do this, you must have previously instructed Amazon to generate an SSH key pair, and to associate it with your Amazon Web Services account.<br/>
If you do not need SSH access to your running instance(s), you do not need to select a key pair from the list.<br/>
For more information on generating an SSH key pair, see the Getting Started Guide (available under the Documentation link <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#resources" target="_blank">here</a>.)<br/>
