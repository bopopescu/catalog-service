<b>Amazon EC2 Instance Types</b><br/>
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides the flexibility to choose from a number of different instance types to meet your computing needs. Each instance provides a predictable amount of dedicated compute capacity.<br/>
If you are not sure which instance type to use, select Small for a 32-bit appliance or Large for a 64-bit appliance.<br/>
