<b>Instance Type</b><br/>
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) has a number of different instance types to meet the specific needs of your image. Each instance type provides a predictable amount of dedicated system resources.<br/>
If you are not sure which instance type to use, select Small for a 32-bit image or Large for a 64-bit image.<br/>
For more information on instance types, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" target="_blank">this page</a>.<br/>
